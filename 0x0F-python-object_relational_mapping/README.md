## Concept Guidance
* [Object-relational mappers](https://www.fullstackpython.com/object-relational-mappers-orms.html)
### [0. Get all states](./0-select_states.py)
> Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:
> * Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
> * Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
> * Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
